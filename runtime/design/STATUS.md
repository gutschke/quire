# STATUS

Current milestone: **M1 — Foundation: god-object decomposition** — **gate closed `ship-with-followups`** (pending user ack on LOC cap re-baseline)

## Gate result (2026-05-21)

Four reviewers spawned in parallel: Engine, Security, Performance, Adversarial. Per execution-plan.md, only Engine and Security have severity-floor authority.

| Reviewer | Verdict | High-severity findings |
|---|---|---|
| Engine | ship-with-followups | 2 (v:1 enforcement, .mjs drift) — **both fixed** in commit `fd33a25` |
| Security | ship-with-followups | 0 |
| Performance | ship-with-followups | 2 (tokens dead-weight, per-keystroke render) — **both fixed** in commit `f80c05d` |
| Adversarial | ship-with-followups | 4 (LOC overrun, session-bootstrap deferral, STATUS cadence, .mjs drift) — last two acked, first two flagged |

After fixes, no severity-floor `block` remains. Gate closes `ship-with-followups` once the LOC re-baseline is resolved.

## LOC overrun — USER ACK REQUIRED

`quire-app.ts` is **2722 LOC**. M1's target was ≤1200. The 1500+ LOC gap is the ~1700 LOC of `renderXxx` methods that the plan's facade-migration step 3 defers to M2 region work (handlers stay on root through M1; render templates extract per-region in M2).

The Adversarial reviewer was correct that raising the cap unilaterally would teach "the cap moves when convenient" (it was already raised once from v0.1's 800 to v0.2's 1200). The honest path is a tiered re-baseline:

**Proposed plan-adjustment (requires user ack):**

| Milestone | LOC cap | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| M1 close | **≤ 2750** | Acknowledges deferred render extraction; current 2722 is within. |
| M2 close | **≤ 1500** | Player-region templates extract from root; handlers may also start moving. |
| M3a close | **≤ 900** | DM cockpit regions extract; handler migration completes for the core regions. |

This caps reduction to specific milestones rather than treating the absolute number as a one-time gate.

**Decision pending.** Until the user accepts the tiered re-baseline (or specifies a different policy), the gate remains technically open on this criterion.

## Acceptance criteria — final state

- [⚠] `src/quire-app.ts` ≤ 1200 LOC — **2722 LOC; tiered re-baseline proposed (above)**
- [x] `src/controllers/session-bootstrap.ts` extracted — minimal (pure helpers); P0-8b queued for follow-up extraction of host/join/leave (Adversarial finding accepted)
- [x] `src/controllers/autosave-controller.ts` extracted
- [x] `src/controllers/ai-key-store.ts` extracted (with 300 ms debounce on localStorage writes per Performance finding)
- [x] `src/sync/working-copy.ts` exists with IndexedDB + in-memory store
- [x] `src/ui/shell/` with `<quire-shell>` + 5 region elements
- [x] `src/ui/styles/tokens.css.ts` exists (not yet consumed; M2 region components will import directly)
- [x] `src/ui/modes/mode-state.ts` + AppMode URL routing
- [x] All 18 new event kinds in `KNOWN_EVENT_KINDS` with `v: 1` versioning + `isPayloadV1` enforcement
- [x] `filterForViewer` helper with unit tests (wiring deferred via P0-4-followup)
- [x] H-4 unknown-kind banner on save load; peer version-gating data captured (UI banner deferred via P0-12-followup-banner)
- [x] CI bundle-size gate active with `bundle-gate.test.ts` + `.mjs` drift test + level-9 gzip alignment
- [x] Bundle ≤ 72 KB gzipped at M1 — **66.15 KB (cap 110 KB after gate's level-9 alignment)**
- [x] All existing tests pass (669 total, +136 from M1 work, 2 skipped); `QuireAppHooks` interface stable
- [x] `STATUS.md` (this file) up to date
- [x] `runtime/design/review-history/` populated per-lens for M1 (4 lens files + 2 unused lens files; accessibility.md dropped per H-7 audit pattern)
- [x] `MAX_EVENTS_PER_SAVE = 100_000` DoS guard (Security gate finding)
- [x] `security.md` updated — AI key-storage threat model + UC sentinel deferred-to-M3b clarification

## Open questions / Blockers

1. **LOC cap re-baseline.** See above. User ack required to apply the tiered proposal OR specify a different policy.
2. **Nothing else blocking M2 entry.** All Engine + Security HIGH findings resolved; medium / low findings tracked as P-tasks in `redesign-plan.md` § "M1 gate — follow-up P-tasks."

## Next planned commit

When LOC re-baseline is resolved: tag `milestone-M1` and open M2 (in-session ergonomics — player view region-extracted).
